<h1>Titanic Survival Prediction</h1>

Titanic Ship

<h3>Problem Statement :</h3>
The problem at hand involves creating a classification algorithm to predict Titanic survival, determining whether a person will be saved from sinking or not based on various factors.

<h3>About Dataset :</h3>

The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage remains one of the most notorious maritime disasters in history. Striking an iceberg, the ship succumbed, resulting in the loss of 1502 lives out of 2224 passengers and crew. This tragic event sent shockwaves across the globe and prompted significant improvements in maritime safety standards.

While chance played a role in survival, certain demographic groups appeared to have higher chances of surviving than others. The challenge at hand involves constructing a predictive model to address the question: "What characteristics made individuals more likely to survive?" using passenger data, including factors such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more.
