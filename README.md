## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to create a classification algorithm to predict Titanic survival. The algorithm determines whether a person will be saved from sinking or not based on various factors.

## About the Dataset
The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage remains one of the most notorious maritime disasters in history. Out of 2224 passengers and crew, 1502 lives were lost when the ship struck an iceberg. This tragic event led to significant improvements in maritime safety standards.

This project utilizes passenger data to explore the factors influencing survival. The dataset includes information such as passenger names, ages, genders, socio-economic classes, and more.

## Training and Evaluation
The model was trained using logistic regression on the Titanic dataset, which was split into training and test sets with a ratio of 80:20. During training, the model iterated over the training data, adjusting its parameters to minimize the loss function. The training data achieved an accuracy score of approximately 80.76%. After training, the model was evaluated on the test data, resulting in an accuracy score of about 78.21%. This evaluation indicates that the model generalizes well to unseen data, suggesting its effectiveness in predicting Titanic survival based on the provided features. Further optimization and fine-tuning of the model may lead to even better performance.

## Result
After training the model, the accuracy score on the test data was approximately 78.21%.
